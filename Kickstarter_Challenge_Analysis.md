## Overview of Project

The overview of this project is to analyze fundraising performance data across a variety of categories and subcategories, goals, and seasonality/timeframe.  

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis to observe how campaigns perform in relation to their launch dates and goals.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

First, campaigns that are launched in the first half of the year tends to perform better than those in the 2nd half of the year. 
Second, May seems to be the butter zone to launch a campaign, in fact May through August is the optimal timeframe to launch a fundraising campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Success rates are more favorable when campaign goals are 15K or less and success rate drops to >50%  when the goal is >15K. 
However there could be potential outliers for the handful of campaign where target goal is between 35-45K and the success rate is >50%. 
This will require a deep dive into what those campaigns are, launch date, audience demographics, and activities that drove pledges.   

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Maybe we should also be looking are relative rates for the launch date analysis rather than absolute numbers, this might help provide a visibility into possible trends. We should also be looking at outliers and not factor those into our analysis. 
We also don't have insight into backer demographic data, this will better inform us on more precise targeting for future campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We should look at relative data to look for trends and a box and whisker chart to look for and account for outliers.
